# **Procreate! A heavenly abode** :arrow_down:

#### <u>How it all started</u> 🏞️
I got my first ever (and the only perhaps) iPad in around November of 2020 I guess. Just to brief you all, it is a 12.9 inch iPad Pro 2020 Wi-Fi + Cellular 1Tb storage 🤘😎<br>
I was looking over the web for inspiration for some amazing art work and almost every tutorial used this application called "Procreate". 
So, I begged my father to get me this app and after months of persuation, he finally gave in and got me the app! (It was either Goodnotes5 📝 or Procreate ​🖍 since I already had Microsoft's OneNote, I went with something unconventional and hence, Procreate)<br>
I started right away, and the results were fabulous. There's this never ending array of brushes and textures and features and what not. 😵

#### <u>The first illustration</u> :small_red_triangle_down:
I followed a very simple youtube tutorial (linked below) to create what I like to call "A Fiery Forest" artwork! The result was unexpected. I used gaussian blur to inflict a pinkish hue on the entirity of my canvas and the gaussian blur effect to replicate the fireflies.<br>

#### <u>A night scene illustration</u> 🌃
This was quite a simple tutorial wherein I learnt about various procreate functionalities, like the automatic shape correction, replicating in horizontal and vertical aspects, clipping mask and the concept of layers in an illustration.<br>

#### <u>I made a kitty as well</u> :smile_cat:
Yeah, the deal is, I freaking love cats, I love 'em to death. But my mother does not allow us to get a pet cat. So, I drew one!

#### <u>A christmas carol perhaps?</u> ❄️
So the trick here was to use two layers and apply gaussian blur on the lower layer to create a "paper cut out" appearance. There are reindeers, Santa Claus and a flying chariot loaded with warm christmas gifts 🎁🛍️ <br>

#### <u>Expecto Patronum</u> 🔮
Did I not tell you that I am a Harry Potter fan? A great tutorial indeed, I added some sparkles and shines on my own to give it a "pottery magical" look (I don't know if that makes sense but it sounds right to me) It so resembles Harry's patronus, a stag! ✨<br>

#### <u>A study in purple</u> 📜
I just felt like recreating something like my own room, a chaotic mess! Here, I used only the subtle shades of purplish-bluish colors. For the sunshine entering through the windows, I used the selection tool 💜

#### <u>A shot at portraits</u> 🥴
Now this, this took me about an entire day of work! I had to pay attention to the shading, the layers were all getting messy at one point. Finally completed it after hours of toiling and I could not have been more proud 😎

#### <u>An abstract attempt of Taylor Swift</u> 🎤
Can you perhaps guess the beautiful song?

#### <u>Be free as a bird</u> 🌇
This illustration here depicts "freedom", the splashes of various hues of blue symbolizes an attempt at expressing ourselves freely. I think it goes really well with the ballerina sillhouette. 🩰

# **Collab with Music Club, IIT Kanpur** 🎹🎶
It so happened that Shreyasi (coordinator, Mclub, IITK) asked me if I would be interested in making some sort of an artwork for their upcoming cover release as a part of **Musical Extravagenza 2021** event. After making a few drafts and discussing some ideas with her, we finally pinpointed to 2-3 images for reference.

I made these two illustrations for Mclub's cover of **"Kyun"** from **"Barfi"**

Well, Shreyasi asked me for some ideas on the theme **"Crazy"** for Mclub's then upcoming cover of **"Crazy"** by **Scary Pockets**<br>

We decided on some ideas based on the original artcover. We thought of abstract objects coming out of a person's head. That, however seemed way too straightforward. Shreyasi then asked me to take as much time as I needed as the release was scheduled much later. I then thought of the liquify tool on procreate. I decided to give it a try and sent Shreyasi a draft; an OK from her was all I needed to move on from here! I then added a sillhouette face and made bars in the remaining area.

**<u>Symbolism of the artwork</u>** The sillhouette face represents our dark and depressed souls (ok, a bit exagerrated I guess). The array of various liquified, twisted and twirled colors is expressive of our crazy and creative nature, an array of feelings, moods and ideas trapped behind the bars made on the right side.<br>
The bars can be anything, it can be the society, it can be our "wrong-wishers" or it can be our negative mentality towards ourselves.<br>

### **One line art** 💚
Here are some of the <u>one line artwork</u> with offset colors, I really enjoyed doing this<br>

This is something rather simple, here I was experimenting with offset colors and changing the layer transparency

I finally managed to make two leaves here! Yay! 🌱

An upgradation from two leaves to a flower with two leaves 🌼

Inspired by the kind words of my friend, Mundada, here is a reminder to all of us "We are all amazing and beautiful in our own ways"
