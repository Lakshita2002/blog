# **Procreate! A heavenly abode** :arrow_down:

#### How it all started 
I was looking over the web for inspiration for some amazing art work and almost every tutorial used this application called "Procreate". 
So, I begged my father to get me this wonderful app and after months of persuation, he finally gave in and got me the app!
I started right away, and the results were fabulous. There's this never ending array of brushes and textures and features and what not.

#### The first illustration :small_red_triangle_down:
I followed a very simple youtube tutorial to create what I like to call "A Fiery Forest" artwork! The result was unexpected. I used gaussian blur to inflict a pinkish hue on the entirity of my canvas and the gaussian blur effect to replicate the fireflies.

#### I made a kitty as well :smile_cat:
Yeah, the deal is, I freaking love cats, I love 'em to death. But my mother does not allow us to get a pet cat. So, I drew one!
